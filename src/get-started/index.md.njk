The examples in the LBS Design System come with code to make it easy for you to use them in your project.

There are guides to getting started:

- [prototyping](prototyping/)
- [in production](production/)

When something is published in the LBS Design System as a [style](/styles/), [component](/components/) or [pattern](/patterns/) we include details of how and when it’s been tested in user research. This should help you decide whether it’s something you can use or adapt for your service.
